          <p>
            Everyone has their own reason to have a website. And my reason is because I wanted a
            small piece of the internet where I can keep my online adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always love to read other websites and to get lost,
            <em>everyone</em> has something interesting to share online, and what is a better place
            than a website where you have control over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel nostalgic and jealous about people who got to explore the internet before it was
            more commercial. Hopefully more people will make websites like it was in the good old
            days.

          <summary><h2>My youtube (2016-2018, 2021)</h2></summary>
          <p>
            I uploaded my first YouTube video in 2016 that was a screen recording of a Roblox game
            (<i>and by “screen recording” I mean I pointed a camera at my screen</i>). Apparently, I
            also did 103(!) livestreams in 2018, <em>none of which I remember</em>. The nice benefit
            of that is I now have a small archive of what I did with my free time in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Anyway cringe aside</em>, my favourite project by far was a series I made called
            <i>[friend's name] being [adjective]</i>. The concept was simple: compilations of funny
            clips with my friends from roblox and discord, sometimes with added edits or jokes. I
            was heavily inspired by
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SovietWomble" target="_blank">SovietWomble</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the online projects I’ve worked on, this is the project I look back at most
            <em>fondly</em>. It wasn’t just fun to collect and edit the clips, although I do have
            about 1,500 of them (<i>with 800 still unorganized, please send help</i>), it was also
            <em>a love letter to the friendships</em> I had at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely want to do this again some time with other people. To me, it feels like a
            digital time capsule of the
            <i>in-jokes</i>, <em>chaos</em>, and <i>joy</i> we shared.

          <summary><h2>Deventer (2020)</h2></summary>
          <p>I hope you like stories because <em>this one is a long one</em>.</p>
          <p>
            so let's start off with what <i>deventer</i> even is. <i>deventer</i> is a city in the
            netherlands but a RP group tried remaking the city in roblox so that is what we are
            talking about here.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>deventer</i> was your average city rp game, you had different groups for the
            emergency services with their own training and rank system. the fun part was I knew a
            <i>friend</i> who was
            <span
              class="info"
              data-tooltip="high rank, a roblox RP term, if you have this rank you are an admin"
              >HR</span
            >, which means they could give me the answers for the tests at the trainings. Let's call
            that friend <i>S</i>...
          </p>
          <p>
            one thing that also happened is <em>I got married on that game</em> with another friend!
            It was a big event with lots of things to do and a whole ceremony, it may sound stupid
            but it was actually quite fun. <br />one thing that kinda bugged me is that one of us
            HAD to change our avatar <i>according to S</i>,
            <em>because 2 girls getting married was weird</em> in their mind. <br />it didn't really
            matter because we quickly got divorced, it was a very unserious relationship,,,
            <i>what do you expect at age 13</i>.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/creations/deventer.png"
            alt="picture of the wedding"
            class="imgborder"
            loading="lazy" />
          <p>
            after all that stuff, they opened an application for a scripter in the group. at that
            time I was playing around with lua scripting so I decided to apply, I barely had any
            experience but <i>S</i> put a good word in for me so I magically got the role,,,
            <em>suddenly I was HR</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime <i>S</i> had some personal stuff happen so that meant they couldn't be
            as active,,,
            <em>as HR you have a quota of minimum amount of trainings you have to host</em> which
            they couldn't reach,,, <i>S</i> tried explaining why they were not as active as before
            but they ultimately got kicked due to inactivity which I don't find fair,
            <i>they expected that personal life was less important than a roblox game</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            my scripting career was slowly coming to an end, to be fair I only did 1 project for
            them <em>(which was a VERY basic script)</em>,,, they didn't clearly communicate what
            had to be done.<br />
            my motivation was fading after <i>S</i> got kicked so I was pretty inactive <br />and
            remember that HRs had minimum quotas?
            <em>because developers are also HRs they have the same training quotas</em>,,, but they
            never explained to me how to host a training so eventually I got kicked for not reaching
            the training quota
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>this was at the start of covid</i> so we had too much time on our hands so that is
            why it will be forever a special time in my mind
          </p>

          <p>
            If you aren’t familiar with roblox aviation, you basically go on a flight just like you
            would in real life, there are passengers and crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            belgium air (<i>later renamed to Aeroute</i>) was a roblox aviation airline I owned. It
            was started by me and a couple of friends, these were some good times, we really had a
            community feeling even though we only had 20 members.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped it because I had other priorities at that time. I do sometimes look back at
            that time and wonder how it would have been if it didn’t stop

            what happens when you're a kid and you have too much time to spend together with your
            friend because it's summer break? <s>building a rocket or fighting a mummy</s>,
            <i> making a magazine of course! </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            we got bored, decided to take some pictures around the house and then made a, and I
            quote, a "<em>girl magazine for all girls</em>". To make it funnier this was long before
            I knew I was trans.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0em">It had amazing articles like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “do you have an irritating girl in the house?” <i>and of course</i> a Interview with
              the mom of the irritating girl
            </li>
            <li>
              a fictional hatchimal ad (<em>because those were popular back then</em>) which in the
              ad now only costs 1000€ thanks to a 50% discount
            </li>
            <li>
              and the main article, 3 girls fighting the (fictional) disease of '<i>firosyde</i>'
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            as far as I can remember we made 2 editions but sadly
            <em> I don’t have any backups of the original digital documents </em> so I only have one
            printed version my dad printed for me. There was a returning motif, if something ended
            on a bad note the last words would be <em>“this is really olala”</em> or
            <i>“I hate it”</i>, if it would end on a good note the last words would be
            <em>“i love it”</em>

              This girl is very irritating, the mother of this child is very angry she wants to send

            <p>
              These children are infected with <i>firosyde</i> a bad disease that is very bad for
              children. We were able to take a look at the treatment of the children if you can't
              stand blood please <em>quickly close this magazine</em>.
            </p>
            <p><em>[bloodstream stock photo]</em></p>
            <p>
              This is what their blood looks like, you can see that they are infected with
              <i>firosyde</i>
              and if their blood doesn't improve then they will <em>die within 2 years</em>. Luckily
              they have a medicine and in a year we are going to take another look at how they are
              doing. we think extremely bad because it has already killed 2 million people, that
              medicine but <i>there's chance for improvement</i>
            </p>
            <p><em>1 year later</em></p>
            <p>
              We are back with the girls with <i>firosyde</i>. Things are going well. But the mother
              thinks they are dying. But they are better. Unfortunately, she has to see the doctor
              every day. But they are better, the medicine has worked well.
              <em> So cool everyone thinks, even us. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the surgery and medicine cost 3000! Euro a month. But they are fortunately fully
              reimbursed. That is equal to 36000! Euro, which is expensive but paid back. <br />
