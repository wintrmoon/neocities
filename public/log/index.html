          <em>"Intentions are everything, Intentions will set you free"</em> –
          <strong>Intentions</strong>, twenty one pilots <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
          this month wasn't the best month, it started off with some heavy stuff that left me empty
          but I'm slowly piecing myself back together again
        </p>

        <p>
          at the beginning of the month I had the chance to apply for my dream job (train
          conductor), I did some online tests and a phone interview that all went well so I got
          invited to an in-person interview
        </p>

        <p>
          we were in a group of <strong>7 people</strong>, we first got a tour of the depot and then
          the interview,,, one by one they did the interviews, so our group became smaller and
          smaller, I got quite unlucky that I was the second last person they interviewed, so I was
          sitting there for like <strong>4 hours</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          sadly they didn’t hire me, and I was so well prepared, but that’s not stopping me from
          <strong>applying next year, I'll get the job one day</strong>!
        </p>

        <p>
          so I'm back at square one in my job search because I was quite convinced I was going to
          get the job,,, either way I'm excited to see where I'll end up at
        </p>

        <p>
          other than that I <strong>volunteered at some concerts</strong>, which was really fun as
          always!
        </p>

        <p>
          on <strong>halloween</strong>, it was a normal concert, nothing special <em>but:</em> the
          bus driver of the band lost his phone <strong>and</strong> then got lost in the city, so
          he was a missing person for a couple of hours, luckily they found him but
          <strong>“not in a state to drive”</strong>,,, this was a first for me
        </p>

          <br />I love adam savage, so when I got this video recommended I was quite curious,,, I
          can easily say that this video changed my way of looking at the world, just wow <br />I
          normally ignore these types of videos because they all say mostly the same thing, but this
          one is
          <strong>different</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>GAMES</h3>
        <p>
          I started playing <strong>fallout new vegas</strong>, and holy shit that game is amazing!
          I already wrote about it a little bit in
          <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=1944139" target="_blank">this blog post</a>,,,
          It's weird that I waited so long to play it
        </p>

        <p>
          I can keep repeating what other people have said about <strong>new vegas</strong> but one
          of the reasons I like it so much is the graphics,,, the graphics aren't fancy but it has a
          cartoon look to it that I like, I don't like the new <strong>fallout</strong> games
          because the monsters are too scary for me but with <strong>new vegas</strong> how can you
          be scared of a goofy looking gecko
        </p>

        <p>
          I think I'm roughly halfway through the game (I'm currently right outside of las vegas),
          but halfway through the month I got distracted by another game,,,
        </p>

        <p>
          I got <strong>tony hawk's pro skater 1 + 2</strong> this month, is just one of the most
          satisfying games to play, it was so fun I even finished it this month, it isn't a long
          game but still, it's unusual of me to complete a game so quickly
        </p>

        <p>
          after trying out the new <strong>skate.</strong> game I was very disappointed so I thought
          I would try out <strong>thps</strong> because I wanted to play a <em>good</em> skating
          game
        </p>

        <p>
          it did take some time to get used to it but it is such a fun experience, I still prefer
          <strong>skate 3 </strong> for a more "realistic" skating game (you cant really call
          <strong>skate 3</strong> realistic but you know what I mean) but <strong>thps</strong> is
          just the best at a arcade type of skating game
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          my plans for November are to hopefully finish <strong>new vegas</strong> and then start
          <strong>yakuza: like a dragon</strong>, maybe with a simulator game in between
          <strong>hollywood animal</strong> and <strong>news tower</strong> look like a lot of fun
          to play in between story heavy games
        </p>

        <h3>TV</h3>
        <p>
          started and finished <strong>the boys</strong> this month, great show that I wished I
          watched sooner. It’s surreal how it mirrors what’s happening right now in
          <strong>america</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          a great show but not without its imperfections, season 4 was kinda a slog, there were some
          filler and side storylines that didn’t do anything to progress the show
          <em>(especially the episode about hughie’s dad)</em>. The finale was okay but it kinda
          just happened. I’m glad the next season will be the last but overall it was a fun show
        </p>

        <p>
          in november <strong>gen v</strong> is next, I know nothing about it except that it’s a
          spin-off series of <strong>the boys</strong>,,, I’m really excited for it, I just hope it
          has less gore and doesn’t feel like a forced spin-off
          <em
            >(future me here, the first scene of the series is already a gory one, yay *coughs*)</em
          >
        </p>

        <h3>MUSIC</h3>
        <p>
          I got into <strong>gorillaz</strong>, their music is so fucking fun to explore, It’s like
          eating at an all you can eat restaurant, I’m still trying out the small snacks before the
          main meal! there are just so many genres and they do it so well! the
          <strong>style</strong> of a band is a big factor for me, and I just love theirs so much
        </p>

        <p>
          current favourite songs from them are <strong>accession</strong>
          <em>(vince staples is great!!)</em> and <strong>cracker island</strong>,,, I'm curious how
          my favourites will change in the future
        </p>

        <p>
          they’re also coming to <strong>rock werchter</strong> with
          <strong>twenty one pilots</strong> as headliner next year which I’m so, so excited for!
          I’m also going to see <strong>linkin park</strong> the week before,,, <br />
          It’s going to be a <strong>very fun festival season</strong> next year!
        </p>
