            <p>
              In terms of my (future) career I did some reflecting ,,, and I'm planning on studying
              <strong>IT</strong> (specifically infrastructure), that was actually my original plan
              last year so I think that makes the most sense
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on this site layout which <strong>I'm SUPER proud of!</strong> if you can't
              tell it's in the style of a terminal from <strong>fallout</strong>,,, I tried making
              every small detail like being able to use the arrow keys and enter to navigate the
              menu and the loading screens<br />
              feel free to give feedback! I wanted to hit the balance of lore friendly and a
              readable site and I think I achieved that
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also looking to make it look more convincing like a real
              <strong>crt</strong> screen, so if you have suggestions for that feel free to let me
              know!!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm maybe thinking of changing my main site to this theme but one part of me likes the
              pink theme and the other likes the terminal, <em>send help please</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>nov-08</strong> today I started something I planned a long time ago,,,
              reorganising my room! to make it clear it's not just some de-cluttering,,, I'm buying
              a second desk, a big kallax, new lamps, etc<br />
              my room layout is completely changing so I'm really excited! I got inspired by
              <a href="https://youtu.be/_SNiAdmA51Q" target="_blank" data-label="PLAY VIDEO"
                >this video</a
              >, those <strong>kuggis</strong> boxes have been a game changer
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>nov-23</strong> I tried my first attempt at a media server and I'm loving
              it!!! finally I can let go of the rotation of streaming services I use
            </p>
            <p>
              it was actually fairly easy and I would recommend anyone to try it out! I just used a
              video to install the *arr stack, its quite easy with docker desktop
            </p>
            <p>
              it was so much fun that I ordered a mini pc
              <em
                >(a <strong>thinkcentre</strong>,,, yes ofc I'm expending my
                <strong>thinkpad</strong> collection)</em
              >
              to run my own home server, I'm ascending to maximum nerd level,,,
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >for anyone reading this that has a home server: any advice to a noobie like me?
                what things do you host on it? etc etc</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>nov-25</strong> went to see a <strong>360°</strong> concert which was
              AWESOME!! that is why I love my local venue, it's quite unique,,, if you ever are in
              belgium you should check out <strong>club wintercirus</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>nov-30</strong> I'm done setting up the mini pc as a
              <strong>home server</strong> and its working quite good! I've ordered some extra ram
              because it kept crashing,,, or maybe its my <strong>proxmox</strong> settings IDK

            when I saw this video in my recommendations I was expecting a video about AI but I was
            quite surprised that there was a big part of the video talking about his educational
            background, which I kinda related to because I got unschooled for my entire life <br />

          <h3>GAMES</h3>

          <p>
            I've been taking my time with <strong>fallout new vegas</strong> this month, trying to
            complete as much side quests as possible but I think this is one of those games where
            you can't see everything, you miss a lot of content when doing one run
            <em>(at least without a guide)</em>,,, and I'm fine with that but that does not mean I'm
            rushing through every story quest, I'm taking my time
          </p>
          <p>
            one thing that is starting to bug me is <strong>the unmarked quests</strong>, I love
            that there is not a lot of hand holding BUT the game gave me 4 unmarked quests in a row
            so what I end up doing is searching it up on the wiki, I don't have a problem with that
            but sometimes it feels like cheating but on the other hand I don't want to miss
            content,,, I'm trying to find a balance between searching the <strong>wiki</strong> and
            trying to solve it on my own but some of these quests are hard without a guide
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-13</strong> <strong>johnny guitar</strong> is making me angry and anxious at
            the same time,,, STOP PLAYING IT ON THE FUCKING RADIO MR NEW VEGAS
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I'm around half way through the game but I only now realized how much there is
            to do, I still have yet to touch the dlc
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also been dabbling in <strong>hitman 1/2/3</strong> this month,,, I'm kinda ashamed
            it's the first time I'm really playing a hitman game<br />
            I tried it a couple of years ago but stealth games make me super anxious but I've learnt
            to embrace that, I'm having lots of fun trying things out,
            <strong>it's like a puzzle game where you happen to need to kill people</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            at first I was scared that it was going to be too hand holding but holy shit,,, it took
            me soo long to finally figure one of the ways you can finish the first level, I love it
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-29</strong> I finished my first <strong>new vegas</strong> dlc,
            <strong>honest hearts</strong>, it was fine nothing special, I'm glad it's over
          </p>

          <h3>TV</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-03</strong> started <strong>gen v</strong> and is such a nice change of pace
            compared to <strong>the boys</strong>, I like the change in setting but also that
            there's less focus on action and the different cast is quite nice
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>emma</strong> is currently my favourite character,,, and
            <strong>jordan</strong> is really freaking great trans representation
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>cate's</strong> version of soldier boy was so funny, it kinda reminded me of how
            <strong>mabel's</strong> imagination in gravity falls would be
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-08</strong> before finishing <strong>gen v</strong> I started
            <strong>nordin</strong> to watch something lighter in between,,, if you can understand
            dutch then check it out, it's really funny!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-10</strong> and I already finished <strong>nordin</strong>, it was a really
            short series, the story was nothing special but the comedy was pretty fun,
            <strong>7/10</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>nov-23</strong> finished <strong>gen v</strong>,,, just wow, I'm really excited
            for the next season of <strong>the boys</strong> to see how they will tie this up
          </p>
          <p>
            next up is <strong>pluribus</strong>,,, when I saw that
            <strong>vince gilligan</strong> made a new series I HAD TO CHECK IT OUT
            <em>(I'm obligated by contract)</em>, and he did it again,,, this guy doesn't make
            anything but masterpieces
          </p>
          <p>
            currently on episode 4 which means I actually have to wait for another episode to
            drop,,, it's been a long time since I've had to wait weekly for a episode of a series
            but I love it, there is a lot of good stuff releasing soon like
            <strong>stranger things</strong> and <strong>fallout</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>MUSIC</h3>
          <p>
            I saw <strong>malevolence</strong> live, it was free so I can't complain (<em
              >I mean,,, the show was great!</em
            >)
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't really like <strong>metal</strong> on streaming, same goes for
            <strong>jazz</strong> (never thought I would compare <strong>metal</strong> and
            <strong>jazz</strong> but yes), not only do the songs sound so much better but the
            energy (okay I lied, this doesn't fully apply to <strong>jazz</strong>) of experiencing
            the same thing with so many people in the same room is pure magic
          </p>
          <p>
            for me a very important part that separates the "okay" bands live and the "amazing"
            bands live is the way they put on a show and how they control their crowd, dare I say
            that <strong>these two are more important than how good the music is</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            yes of course you need good music to make people feel the energy but then you actually
            have to do something with that energy
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>metal</strong> is one of those genre that does this really well, not only do you
            see the band having a great time on stage but the crowd takes that energy and pushes it
            to the max, and most of those bands know how to take advantage of it<br />
            I really admire the energy of metal shows, even as someone who's really scared of mosh
            pits
          </p>
          <p>
            it was a show with 3 opening acts so there were
            <strong>32 band members</strong> backstage, it was really busy backstage
          </p>
          <p>
            other than live shows I've been listening to a lot of older music lately, more
            specifically the <strong>fallout 4 and new vegas</strong> soundtrack,,, diamond city
            radio is peak <strong>fallout</strong> music! but for the love of god I can't hear
            'johnny guitar' ever again,,, "play it again, johnny guitar"
            <strong> NO JOHNNY YOU WILL NOT, FUCK YOU </strong>
