            last 25 years,,, expect for <i>weird al</i>,,, so that means that if I hear the original
            song I think <em>'oh its that one weird al song but the lyrics are wrong'</em>,, I'm

            it's the first time I don't feel really worried in life, I always worry about either my
            <i>social life</i> or <em>my career</em> but I think I'm slowly starting to figure both
            of those out

              <em>1:</em> it's been super long since I've ever been in a <i>friend group</i> and now
              I can finally say that I'm back in a group <em>where I can be myself</em> and not have

          <p>
            to start off this new page I would like to share a little story that happened last week:
          </p>

          <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more</summary>

            <p>
              in the busier seasons I get to see at least 150 different passengers on the train in
              my zone on one trip <em>(with 500~ in total on the train)</em>, some of these people I
              get to know a little, thanks to the fact I spend at least 16 hours with them
            </p>
            <p>
              there was this couple on the train that recognized me from another journey they did
              and then they started to talk about how happy they were to see me again and that the
              small attention to detail really matter, they said that my friendlies really made a
              difference for their trip. that was the nicest compliment I have gotten in my career
              so far! at the end of the conversation they asked for 2 paper cups, I said
              <i>'no problem I'll get them in a bit'</i>, I go check in the other passengers, and
              then a couple minutes later I end my shift because my work was done, then I leave the
              train,,, now 5 minutes after the train has left I REMEMBER
              <em>I STILL HAD TO BRING THOSE CUPS</em>, the lady was so sweet to me AND THEN I
              FORGET SOMETHING SO SIMPLE, FUCK ME
            </p>
            <p>
              but it's nice to hear that <i>those small details DO get recognized</i>, and hearing
              this after having one of the less enjoyable Interactions at work makes it all so much
              worth it
            </p>
