          <p>a long yap about paper and pens because why not</p>

          <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more</summary>

            <p>
              I'm kinda a snob when it comes to anything stationary related, like it has to be
              <em> A5 dotted cream paper from leucthrum</em>, sorry I'm not writing anything down on
              your cheap ass post-it notes
            </p>
            <p>
              my love for writing and documenting things is only <i>partially</i> the writing part,
              what I love the most about it is just the experience of sitting down with my pen or
              keyboard and experimenting,,,
              <em> trying to draw weird shapes with a brush pen</em> or
              <i> trying out a new program to write with </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              <s>I have experimented with a lot of different pens</s> okay that's a lie, I used to
              write a lot with <em>bic pens</em> but a couple of years ago I tried
              <i>zebra sarasa clip</i> pens and fell in love, writing with the right pen and paper
              is a night and day difference,
              <em>writing is just so much more fun when it's smooth</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              I bought a <i>rotring 600</i> pen to try something different,,, and I hate to say that
              I don't like it as much, <em>I freaking love the design</em> and it's the best feeling
              pen I have ever written with but my writing just looks smoother when writing with a
              <i>sarasa</i> pen,,, I'm gonna try a different refill and see how that goes, it's
              kinda funny that <em> a pen 10 times the price doesn't write as good </em>,,, to be
              honest I only bought that pen because I like the design of it
            </p>
            <p>
              just as I'm obsessed with pens, I am also obsessed with digital writing tools,,, I
              recently discovered
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck/" target="_blank">writerdecks</a>
              <small>
                (also check out
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/" target="_blank">cyberdecks</a>)</small
              >,
              <em
                >just imagine a very bad laptop that you can only use to write with, it's
                amazing</em
              >,,, most people make their own diy decks, it kinda reminds me of the terminal in the
              fallout games,,, I currently don't really want to spend the money on something like
              that but the next best thing is just using WordGrinder with a clicky mechanical
              keyboard
            </p>
            <p>
              anyway so my point is uhh that uh hmm,,,
              <i> I just wanted to yap about my stationary obsession</i>, I didn't even get the
              chance to talk about notebooks,,, so my point is;
              <em>
                make writing a fun hobby by making the process fun, the end result doesn't really
                matter
              </em>

            okay so I have this weird thing that I start hating my <i>pfp</i> and start cringing
            about it after a while for no real reason
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>it has nothing to do with the design</em> or something but for me my <i>pfp</i> is
            <em> a part of my online identity </em> and sometimes after a while I start seeing
            something that doesn't represent me in it
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess this started like 4-5 years ago when I said some stupid stuff in a friend group
            which basically ruined one of my friendships, anyway, every time I see the
            <i>pfp</i> that I had at the time I just start cringing and feeling anxious,
            <em> looking back I see this awful monster </em> in that <i>pfp</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm probably not the only one that does this
            <small><em>(I mean the changing pfp part, not the ruining friendships part)</em></small>

            I had the recent news of lil nas x on my mind for a bit so I just want to write out my

              I think it's clear that humans aren't made for this level of fame <br />
              this also isn't the first time he had done stuff like this, he already made some
              unusual videos in the past
            </p>
            <p>
              I do <i>NOT</i> believe this is a stunt,,, why do people assume that just because it's
              lil nas x that it is a stunt, in the mean time he has released stuff without stunts, I
              don't think he would fake a breakdown just to release an album a week later <br />I
              get why you want to make that conclusion but please be respectful, I really hope he
              gets better,,,

            it's the first time I don't feel really worried in life, I always worry about either my

              <em>1:</em> it's been super long since I've ever been in a <i>friend group</i> and now
              I can finally say that I'm back in a group <em>where I can be myself</em> and not have

            <p>
              in the busier seasons I get to see at least 150 different passengers on the train in
              my zone on one trip <em>(with 500~ in total on the train)</em>, some of these people I
              get to know a little, thanks to the fact I spend at least 16 hours with them
            </p>
            <p>
              there was this couple on the train that recognized me from another journey they did
              and then they started to talk about how happy they were to see me again and that the
              small attention to detail really matter, they said that my friendlies really made a
              difference for their trip. that was the nicest compliment I have gotten in my career
              so far! at the end of the conversation they asked for 2 paper cups, I said
              <i>'no problem I'll get them in a bit'</i>, I go check in the other passengers, and
              then a couple minutes later I end my shift because my work was done, then I leave the
              train,,, now 5 minutes after the train has left I REMEMBER
              <em>I STILL HAD TO BRING THOSE CUPS</em>, the lady was so sweet to me AND THEN I
              FORGET SOMETHING SO SIMPLE, FUCK ME
            </p>
            <p>
              but it's nice to hear that <i>those small details DO get recognized</i>, and hearing
              this after having one of the less enjoyable Interactions at work makes it all so much
              worth it
