          <h2>29/06/2025 - The least known artist I listen to</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.youniss.co/" target="_blank">Youniss</a> is one of the most
            underrated artists I listen to. If I have to recommend one song it’s simply
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQW2is9BeEs" target="_blank">Escaper</a>. the
            sounds and his general style as an artist blends so well together.
            <em
              >the arabic influences combined with the noisy production are something I never heard
              before</em
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was very lucky to see him live
            <i>(technically I was working, I just heard him from afar)</i>
            but you can imagine that his music hits differently live,
            <em>I won’t forget that day</em>. I’m quite amazed seeing he doesn’t have more
            followers, even locally I haven’t heard his name much.
          </p>

            my personal favourite is
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cbVRvYI1RU" target="_blank">Walad</a>, it’s a
            noisy adventure that somehow makes my head very happy! he’s seriously slept on,
            <i>go listen!</i>
